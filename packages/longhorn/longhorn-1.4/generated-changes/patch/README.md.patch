 3. Make sure `bash`, `curl`, `findmnt`, `grep`, `awk` and `blkid` has been installed in all nodes of the Kubernetes cluster.
 4. Make sure `open-iscsi` has been installed, and the `iscsid` daemon is running on all nodes of the Kubernetes cluster. For GKE, recommended Ubuntu as guest OS image since it contains `open-iscsi` already.

+To prevent Longhorn from being accidentally uninstalled (which leads to data lost), we introduce a new setting, deleting-confirmation-flag. If this flag is **false**, the Longhorn uninstallation job will fail. Set this flag to **true** to allow Longhorn uninstallation. You can set this flag using setting page in Longhorn UI or `kubectl -n longhorn-system patch -p '{"value": "true"}' --type=merge lhs deleting-confirmation-flag`
+
+To prevent damage to the Kubernetes cluster, we recommend deleting all Kubernetes workloads using Longhorn volumes (PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim, StorageClass, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, etc).
+
+From Rancher Cluster Explorer UI, navigate to Apps page, delete app `longhorn` then app `longhorn-crd` in Installed Apps tab.
